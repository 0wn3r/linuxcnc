= System Requirements

== Minimum Requirements

The minimum system to run LinuxCNC and Ubuntu may vary depending on the
exact usage. Stepper systems in general require faster threads to
generate step pulses than servo systems. Using the Live-CD you can test
the software before committing a computer. Keep in mind that the
Latency Test numbers are more important than the processor speed for
software step generation. More information on the Latency Test is 
<<latency-test,here>>.
In addition LinuxCNC needs to be run on an operating system that uses a
specially modified kernel. See <this section,Kernel and Version Requirements>

Additional information is on the LinuxCNC Wiki site:

http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Hardware_Requirements[Wiki.LinuxCNC.org, Hardware_Requirements]

LinuxCNC and Ubuntu should run reasonably well on a computer with the
following minimum hardware specification. These numbers are not the
absolute minimum but will give reasonable performance for most stepper
systems.

* 700 MHz x86 processor (1.2 GHz x86 processor recommended)
* 384 MB of RAM (512 MB up to 1 GB recommended)
* 8 GB hard disk
* Graphics card capable of at least 1024x768 resolution, which is not
   using the NVidia or ATI fglrx proprietary drivers, and which is not an
   onboard video chipset that shares main memory with the CPU
* A network or Internet connection (not strictly needed, but very useful
   for updates and for communicating with the LinuxCNC community)

Minimum hardware requirements change as Ubuntu evolves so check the 
https://help.ubuntu.com[Ubuntu] web site for details on the LiveCD you're using.
Older hardware may benefit from selecting an older version of the LiveCD when
available.

== Kernel and Version requirements

LinuxCNC requires a kernel modified for realtime use to control real
machine hardware. It can, however run on a standard kernel in simulation
mode for purposes such as checking G-code, testing config files and
learning the system.
To work with these kernel versions there are two versions of LinuxCNC
distributed.

The realtime kernel options are preempt-rt, RTAI and Xenomai.

You can discover the kernel version of your system with the command

 uname -a

=== Preempt-RT

Preempt-RT is the newst of the realtime systems, and is also the version
that is closest to a mainline kernel. Preempt-RT kernels are available
as precompiled packages from the main repositories. The search term
"PREEMPT_RT" will find them, and one can be downloaded and installed
just like any other package.
Preempt-RT will generally have the best driver support and is the only
option for systems using the Mesa ethernet-connected hardware driver
cards. In general preempt-rt has the worst latency of the available
systems, but there are exceptions.

RTAI has been the mainstay of LinuxCNC distributions for many years. It
will generally give the best realtime performance in terms of low
latency, but might have poorer peripheral support and not as many screen
resolutions. An RTAI lernel is available from the LinuxCNC package
repository. If you installed from the Live/Install image then switching
kernel and LinuxCNC flavour is described in [Installing-RTAI].

Xenomai is also supported, but you will have to find or build the kernel
and compile LinuxCNC from source to utilise it.

== Problematic Hardware

=== Laptops

Laptops are not generally suited to real time software step
generation. Again a Latency Test run for an extended time will give you
the info you need to determine suitability.

=== Video Cards

If your installation pops up with 800 x 600 screen resolution then
most likely Ubuntu does not recognize your video card or monitor.
Onboard video many times causes bad real time performance.
